__TIL.__ [pylon.css](https://almonk.github.io/pylon/) got me thinking: are there any issues with using ad-hoc custom HTML elements like this? The HTML spec clarifies that a `<myelement>` (without a hyphen in its name) is interpreted as a [HTMLUnknownElement](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#htmlunknownelement) and, furthermore:

> User agents must treat elements and attributes that they do not understand as semantically neutral; leaving them in the DOM (for DOM processors), and styling them according to CSS (for CSS processors), but not inferring any meaning from them.

So using custom elements for layout doesn't seem to be much worse than plain `<div>` elements.
