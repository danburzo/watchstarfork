> All I want is to be someone that makes new things and thinks about them. — a haiku by John Maeda

__React.__ [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) has just hit version 8, and seems a robust and comprehensive library for drag-and-drop interactions. [react-keyboardist](https://github.com/soska/react-keyboardist) is for adding keyboard shortcuts to your app. [atomic-layout](https://github.com/kettanaito/atomic-layout) uses CSS Grid to build layouts, looks promising. [react-from-zero](https://github.com/kay-is/react-from-zero) uses annotated code examples that work directly in the browser to teach React basics.

__Essays.__ [Balancing Time](https://css-tricks.com/balancing-time/) / [Mediocre ideas, showing up, and persistence](https://chriscoyier.net/2013/10/18/mediocre-ideas-showing-up-and-persistence/) / [Reclaiming RSS](https://ar.al/2018/06/29/reclaiming-rss/) / [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) / [Anti-Flow](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/anti-flow/).

__Reference.__ [An explanation](https://github.com/stereobooster/package.json) of all the different fields in `package.json` /  [Inclusive design principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/) / [Tips for writing better](https://medium.com/@jesseddy/tips-for-designers-to-become-better-copywriters-from-the-experts-part-1-cbd3720cbd88).

__Parting thought.__ Programming wisdom around "premature" optimization — identifying it as the root of all evil, even — is one of the maddeningly pervasive sound bites that tends to shore up on my timeline from time to time. Left unexamined, it's misunderstood as a carte blanche for writing inefficient code. Emil Persson [writes a response](http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=News&ID=383) to the latest offender.
