### Things I built

* [CMYK Named Colors](https://danburzo.github.io/webcolors-cmyk)
* [node-lcms](https://github.com/danburzo/node-lcms)

I tried my hand at my first Next.js website. I used MDX and deployed it to GitHub Pages. After some fiddling, and acknowledging some limitations, I'm pretty happy with the setup and I think I'll use it more.

[Dynamic Routes](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/7607) should be cool.

### Today I Learned

You can have more than one submit button in a HTML form, pointing to different URLs with [the `formaction` attribute](https://css-tricks.com/separate-form-submit-buttons-go-different-urls/) (Chris Coyer, via Paul Robert Lloyd).
