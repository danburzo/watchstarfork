### Today I learned

#### Yak shaving 

Recently I've made some updates to [Marcel](https://github.com/marceljs/marcel), my personal take on static site generators. I was fond of the elegance of the [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) templating language and was looking for an equivalent. For JavaScript there's [Nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks) which is pretty great, but rather limited. With [modest outcomes](https://github.com/marceljs/nunjucks-embed) in trying to understand its parser and extend it to make Nunjucks more like Twig, I'm thinking: _‘how hard can it be to implement a template language from scratch?’_

(Greek choir goes mad at this point.) 

_‘Since I'm basically reinventing the SSG wheel with Marcel, I might as well go a level deeper into yak shaving, right? It's not like there's a deadline to this thing.’_

I vacillated around a set of names — _feuille_ (very Proustian but hard to write and pronounce), _enaml_ (which turns out is the name of [something else](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml)), _lagoml_ ("just enough", but sort of not good enough), _fka-twig_ (_coughs intently_), and finally the perfect name that is [Sontag](https://github.com/marceljs/sontag).

I'm working at the limits of my knowledge here, so it's a learning experience.

#### Parsing JavaScript 

With Sontag, I was curious how much of template parsing you can offload to a JavaScript parser. With some light tokenizing of tags, comments, and expressions, and then evaluating expressions as JavaScript, turns out you can go [pretty far](https://github.com/marceljs/acorn-sontag). Tools that I found essential in the process: [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) to parse the JavaScript to an ECMAScript Abstract Syntax Tree, [acorn-walk](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/tree/master/acorn-walk) and [estraverse](https://github.com/estools/estraverse) to walk the tree and swap nodes around, then finally [astring](https://github.com/davidbonnet/astring) to turn the tree back into a string.

How do you evaluate JavaScript? `eval()` feels icky even for a language that ostensibly [treats security as a non-goal](https://github.com/marceljs/sontag#a-note-on-security). The slighly less bad, and more flexible, approach is to create a new function with a certain body, and then invoke it to get the result:

```js
let fn = new Function(`return ${some_expression}`);
fn.call(context); // => result
```

Where's `AsyncFunction` though? Unlike `Function`, the `AsyncFunction` constructor is not a global object. Instead, you'll need to pick it up from an actual async function's constructor:

```js
let AsyncFunction = Object.getPrototypeOf(async () => {}).constructor;

let fn = new AsyncFunction(`return await ${ some_expression }`);
await fn.call(context); // => result
```

#### Getting comfortable with regular expressions 

Regular expressions are brilliant for matching expressions whose vocabulary is rather contained. Robust regular expressions can become a bit hard to read and debug, though. I found [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) to be quite helpful in authoring and understanding them. Some surprises:

__`.+` (any character) does not match `\n` (newline) characters.__ Apparently this is [a whole thing](https://2ality.com/2017/07/regexp-dotall-flag.html), and I was momentarily excited there's a `/s` flag to address it, but it's not supported across the board yet. So naturally I reach for `[.\n]`, a.k.a. _any character or the newline character_ (or so I thought). But,

__The `.` in `[.\n]` is just a dot__. When inside a character set, `.` loses its special status. TIL.

__Supplanting `\s`.__ The [xregexp](http://xregexp.com/) library implements the `/s` flag, and also allows you to name and annotate your capture groups, which seems useful, but I didn't end up using it (mental note for another day). In the interim I'm using `[^]+` (all characters except no character) instead of `.+`.

__The limits of regular expressions.__ It may be that regular expressions can't be the only mechanism to parse things when they become complicated, and you need to bring out the big guns. In a happy coincidence, Benedikt Deicke is writing on the AppSignal blog these days about implementing a templating language in Ruby, with posts on [lexers](https://blog.appsignal.com/2019/07/02/ruby-magic-brewing-our-own-template-lexer-in-ruby.html) and [parsers](https://blog.appsignal.com/2019/07/30/ruby-magic-ruby-templating-the-parser.html) so far, and the posts seem easy to follow.
