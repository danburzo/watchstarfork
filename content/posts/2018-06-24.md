__Design Systems.__ The GDS system published the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

__Creative coding.__ [rabbitear](https://rabbitear.org/) is an origami-building library for the web.

__TIL.__ I didn't know this about this about the String [split()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) method:
