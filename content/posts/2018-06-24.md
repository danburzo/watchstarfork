__React.__ [react-sizeme](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-sizeme) sounds like it could be useful for measuring DOM nodes after they're rendered. The React folks are working on a [Profiler](https://twitter.com/brian_d_vaughn/status/1009977215176491008) tool, which may make things like _why-did-you-update_ (or my own _ytho_, which I've recently nuked), useless. [react-pdf](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf) promises to let you build PDFs in JSX.

__Design Systems.__ The GDS system published the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

__Static site generators.__ [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) shares the ethos of marceljs. [twig.js](https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js) and [twing](https://github.com/ericmorand/twing) are two implementations of the Twig template language in JavaScript.

__Creative coding.__ [rabbitear](https://rabbitear.org/) is an origami-building library for the web.

__JavaScript.__ I didn't know this about this about the String [split()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) method:

> If `separator` is a regular expression that contains capturing parentheses, then each time `separator` is matched, the results (including any undefined results) of the capturing parentheses are spliced into the output array.

__Soundtrack.__ [Driftmachine â€” Shunter](https://umorrex.bandcamp.com/album/shunter)
