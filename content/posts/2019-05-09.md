### TIL

#### Computed styles in the clipboard

I was abruptly reminded that when you copy some text from a web page, WebKit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari) will adorn the `text/html` entry in the clipboard with several inline styles — `font-size`, `font-family`, `color`, `background-color`, and many more — that it computes by looking at the element and its ancestors in the DOM.

My colleagues and I are working rich text editing capabilities based on `contenteditable` and when the user pastes some content, you usually want to strip out the extraneous styles. Nobody wants to use a text they copied from a "dark mode" website _as-is_, right? 

But now we wanted to add support for coloring and highlighting portions of the text in the RTE editor, and realized that as the user copies and pastes text around, we can't discern whether the values for `color` and `background-color` are something our editor has set (matching the author's intention) or whether it was picked up from some ancestor in the DOM (and should therefore be discarded). 

After many attempts at _somehow_ marking up the `<span>`s so that we know _we had set the color_, and failing due to the browser's style computation process wherein all CSS colors are serialized to their `rgba()` equivalent, we found a variant that seems promising:

```html
<div contenteditable>
	<span style='background-color: var(--dummy-var, #f0f0f0)'>Hello</span>
	World
</div>
```

Using an inexistent CSS variable with [a fallback value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties#Custom_property_fallback_values) we prevent Chrome/Safari from computing a `rgba()` equivalent of the color and we can definitely tell that it was us who put it there. More details [in this Chromium issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=960315).

P.S.: You can use [`clipboard-inspector`](https://evercoder.github.io/clipboard-inspector/) to peek into your clipboard.

#### Loading local files in [Observable](https://observablehq.com/)

As I'm adding features to [culori](https://github.com/evercoder/culori), Observable is the perfect place to test them visually before I push a new version to npm. I wondered whether you could load a local version of the library into a notebook, so I don't have to publish pre-releases to npm (which, to this day, I'm not 100% sure how to do), and it turns out you can!

You just start up a local server (the quickest is to run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in your project directory), and then in the notebook load the library from `127.0.0.1`:

```js
culori = require('http://127.0.0.1:8000/build/culori.umd.js')
```

> In Firefox, using `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` [won't work](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=903966).

Mike Bostock points out that you can also [use `<input type='file'>`](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/reading-local-files) in the notebook to load local files.
