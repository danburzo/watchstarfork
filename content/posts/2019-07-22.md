### Today I learned

__Minimal patterns.__ I love Scott Jehl's thinking on making enhancements to bridge the gap to future browser functionality:

> Many of my favorite JavaScript patterns deliberately aim to one day become obsolete. That's not to say scripts built to last are inherently any worse. I just particularly love patterns that are designed to be a bridge to a future where they'll do nothing at all. — Scott Jehl ([source](https://twitter.com/scottjehl/status/1152304480169398272))

His latest is a simple pattern for [loading CSS asynchronously](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/):

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' media='print' onload="this.media='all'"/>
```

This works because browsers load _print_ stylesheets asynchronously (since, presumably, they're not needed for displaying the page in the browser). All that's left is to flip the switch to `media='all'` once the stylesheet loads. It has better browser support than [the alternative approach](https://web.dev/defer-non-critical-css), but you might also want to include a plain stylesheet when JavaScript is not enabled:

```html
<!-- Full example -->
<link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' media='print' onload="this.media='all'"/>
<noscript>
	<link rel='stylesheet' href='style.css' media='all'/>
</noscript>
```
