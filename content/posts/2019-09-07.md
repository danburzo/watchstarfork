### Today I Learned

__Some ffmpeg things.__ I wanted to repeat a 1-second video to make a 20-second video. The command is:

```bash
fffmpeg -stream_loop 20 -i one-sec.mp4 twenty-sec.mp4
```

But the TIL was that ffmpeg has had some bugs in this area, and after trying some alternative methods, it turns out all I needed to do was to upgrade to the latest version. It worked flawlessly.

__Other ffmpeg things.__ Brian Whitman shares a brilliant command to [make a sound collage](https://gist.github.com/bwhitman/5be2f905556a25145dbac74fe4080739) from the sound in your iPhone live photos / Ashley Blewer & colleagues have compiled [a guide to ffmpeg](https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/) / Here are [ffmpeg recipes and notes I'm collecting](https://github.com/danburzo/toolbox/blob/master/ffmpeg.md)
