### Today I Learned

__Tagged template literals.__ Andy Bell shares [this neat trick](https://gist.github.com/andybelldesign/102804f890f1d8aab6a4325ac141da87) for enabling HTML syntax highlighting for plain strings:

```js
const html = str => str;

// without the tag 
`<div class='hello'>
	World
</div>`

// with the tag
html`<div class='hello'>
	World
</div>`
```

`String.raw` ([last edition's TIL](./2019-04-18.md)) also works nicely for this purpose, and allows interpolating values in the template:

```js
const html = String.raw;

html`<div class=${className}>
	${text}
</div>`
```

_Update:_ There are some differences between `String.raw` and having no tag, so use [`dummy-tag`](https://npmjs.com/package/dummy-tag) instead for the most consistent result.

__Webpack performance.__ To find out which steps in a Webpack build process take most time, run your build with these flags:

```bash
webpack --profile --progress
```

You'll get a list of timings like the one below (which is abridged for brevity):

```
12527ms building modules         
40ms hashing
491ms chunk assets processing
19280ms chunk asset optimization            
3566ms after chunk asset optimization  
215ms emitting              
```
