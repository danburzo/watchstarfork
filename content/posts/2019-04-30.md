__TIL.__ Andy Bell shares [this neat trick](https://gist.github.com/andybelldesign/102804f890f1d8aab6a4325ac141da87) for enabling HTML syntax highlighting for plain strings:

```js
const html = str => str;

html`<div class='hello'>World</div>`
```

`String.raw` ([last edition's TIL](./2019-04-18.md)) also works nicely for this purpose, and allows interpolating values in the template.
