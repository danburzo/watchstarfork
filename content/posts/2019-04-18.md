__Work(life).__ Stefanie Posavec [asks](https://twitter.com/stefpos/status/1118070093303435265): _any tips for how you've actively gotten out of creative ruts / changed the direction of your creative practice?_ / [The Underestimated Merits of Copying Someone's Work](https://www.subtraction.com/2016/08/11/the-underestimated-merits-of-copying-someone-elses-work/) (2016) by Khoi Vinh.

__CMS.__ [charge](https://github.com/brandonweiss/charge), a static site generator. (cf. _The underestimated merits of implementing your own SSG_) / [servor](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor), a very lightweight local server.

__TIL.__ [`String.raw`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/raw) is the "default" tag function, (almost¹) the same as writing a template literal without a tag:

```js
String.raw`You have ${10} items` // => "You have 10 items"
`You have ${10} items` // => "You have 10 items"
```

¹ __Update:__ There are some difference between the two in regards to backslash escaping:

```js
String.raw`Hello\nWorld`; // => "Hello\\nWorld"
`Hello\nWorld`; // => "Hello\nWorld"
```

You can, instead, use the [`dummy-tag`](https://npmjs.com/package/dummy-tag) package, which implements a default interpolation.
