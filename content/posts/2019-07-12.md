# Keeping up 

_Looked into a couple of things which were on my radar for a long time._

__WordPress Gutenberg.__ Tried a fresh WP install with the [Gutenberg editor](https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg) and now I think I see how it's going to change a lot about building and writing for WP websites. [There's an official guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/) for building custom blocks. It's a bit convoluted and weird from a JS-first perspective, but I can get used to it. CSS Tricks has a [series of tutorials](https://css-tricks.com/guides/learning-gutenberg/), and this article by Jerome Duncan seems [pretty on point](https://bigbite.net/creating-advanced-block-gutenberg/) (but I haven't read it through).

__Web Components.__ Started implementing a few simple web components to get a feel for it. There's potential, there are limitations, all in all an excellent addition to the web platform. [I'm chronicling my experience here](https://github.com/danburzo/webcomponents-recipes).

__[`WeakMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap) and [`WeakSet`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet)__. Although these JavaScript data structures have been available across browsers since a while, I haven't looked into what they are, and what they're good for, until now. Prompted by only barely grokking [the recent v8 announcement](https://v8.dev/features/weak-references), I read up on them and, boy, [this article](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2014/01/13/hiding-implementation-details-with-e6-weakmaps.html) by Nick Fitzgerald about using `WeakMap` for information hiding is kind of blowing my mind. May this technique be useful for hiding details in Web Components? It warrants further investigation.

__Quote of the day__ comes from [an anecdote](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18334898) about Roberto Ierusalimschy, the main author of the Lua programming language. When asked by a student whether they should make a pull request for a new feature, he replied:

> Yes, but I won't use your code. I love that people send me ideas, but I actually enjoy coding... so I will gladly take your suggestions, though I will write it myself.
