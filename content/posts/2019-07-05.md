### Things I learned

__I made this.__ An old idea, finally realized: [CMYK Named Colors](https://danburzo.github.io/webcolors-cmyk). I thought I'd give Next.js a shot for this project. Deploying it to GitHub Pages turned out to be [a bit fiddly](https://github.com/danburzo/toolbox/blob/master/nextjs.md), but other than that I'm pretty happy with the outcome. Server-side rendered React feels good and I think I'll use this setup for more projects.

__Position: sticky.__ It's also the first time I used the `position: sticky` CSS property for navigation — I guess it hadn't occurred to me it had [such wide support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sticky)? A minimal setup:

```css
header {
	position: -webkit-sticky; /* For Safari */
	position: sticky; /* For all the other browsers */
	top: 0; /* Where to stick */
	z-index: 100; /* Ensure proper stacking */
}
```

> The `z-index` part is to ensure consistent stacking across browsers. I bumped into "incorrect" stacking in Firefox, but there seems to be [a discussion around it](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1053)

A nice addition to this CSS property would be a `:stuck` pseudo-class selector, so you can style the element based on whether it's in its sticky state. [There are good reasons](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1656) for why this doesn't exist in CSS, but you can roll your own [`sticky-change` event](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/sticky-headers) with IntersectionObserver.

__Inputs on iOS.__ Everybody's used to iOS Safari zooming into `<select>` elements when you use them. But why? Turns out it happens when the font size for the element falls below 16px. Being a fan of the `em` unit, I came up with this to fix it:

```css
select { 
	font-size: max(1em, 16px); 
}
```

Curiously, Safari is the only current browser supporting [the `max()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max).

Speaking of inputs, I haven't looked into why `<input type='range'/>` is so capricious in iOS Safari. Sometimes it's very responsive, other times you struggle with grabbing the handle.

__The `formaction` attribute.__ You can have [more than one submit button](https://css-tricks.com/separate-form-submit-buttons-go-different-urls/) in a HTML form, pointing to different URLs.
