### TIL

__The [`append()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ParentNode/append) DOM method__, an alternative to `appendChild()` that lets you add many elements (and text nodes) at once.

#### Intercepting "plain clicks"

Problem: you have a bunch of links which are supposed to work like normal links. But, on a "plain click", you want to execute some equivalent JavaScript (think _turbolinks_ or _pjax_). How do you do that in the most unobtrusive way?

A workable solution below. (Can it be improved?)

```js
const isPlainClick = e =>

	// The primary button was clicked...
	e.button === 0 &&

	// ...and no modifier keys are present
	!e.ctrlKey &&
	!e.metaKey &&
	!e.shiftKey &&
	!e.altKey;

el.addEventListener('click', e => {
	if (isPlainClick(e)) {
		e.preventDefault();
		doStuff();
	}
})
```
