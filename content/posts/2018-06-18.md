__React.__ [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) looks like a fast way to render _lots_ of objects in a viewport, without compromising the performance; seems to be a refresh of [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)? / Speaking of refreshes, [reach-router](https://github.com/reach/router) from the creator of [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) / [react-powerplug](https://github.com/renatorib/react-powerplug) has some useful little components / [react-focus-marshall](https://github.com/jossmac/react-focus-marshal) traps the keyboard tabbing focus within a component / I should check out [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library).

__Static site generators.__ Regular reminder that [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is fucking fast / [Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) is written in JavaScript and works with nunjucks templates, which are like Twig templates from PHP (or Liquid in Ruby, or Jinja2 in Python) — my favorite tempalting language.

__Bundlers.__ [parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) is fast and lovely and you set it up in about a minute for a new project. 

__Coding life.__ Finally looked at [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and like it very much; also added [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and set up a `precommit` hook to run prettier on committed code / [docz](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz) is a promising — but still in progress — project on writing docs for React projects using MDX (Markdown + JSX); and Facebook launched[docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which is more in the vein of [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/), I think.
