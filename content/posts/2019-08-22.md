### Today I Learned

__`npx` things from GitHub.__ Turns out `npx` works with GitHub as well, and you can even specify a branch:

```bash
npx username/repository#branch
```

This is great: if you're building a Node CLI, people can test experimental branches without you needing to publish them to npm. Speaking of `npx`, Rich Harris made [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit), a tool to pull the latest commit off a GitHub repo. It also supports branches, so you can run:

```bash
npx degit username/repository#branch
``` 

and you'll get a snapshot of the repo in your current folder. As opposed to `git clone`-ing it, you don't get the entire Git history. This is useful for bringing in starter/template repositories.

__Bye-bye FTP, hello `rsync`.__ Small websites, e.g. WordPress blogs, can be published on cheap shared hosting. In the past, I'd used FTP to upload local changes to the server, and [Transmit](https://www.panic.com/transmit/) Sync removed the most annoying parts. But cheap shared hosting comes with a palette of quirks and little recourse to fix them, and my last experience was the straw that broke the camel's back. The host seemed to crap out after a few Sync runs and stopped accepting FTP connections. I knew about [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) but never looked into it, but now I'm glad I did.

You'll need to look for cheap shared hosting that allows you to connect via SSH, but most seem to provide it these days. 

I had already generated a SSH key pair for using with GitHub, so I copied the _public_ key:

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```

and added it to the hosting provider, in a dedicated section of the typically byzantine admin UI that varies from provider to provider. 

I needed to add some config in the `~/.ssh/config` file to define how to connect to the SSH host, because it used a different port than the default `22`, but also because I wanted to include the `rsync` script on a public GitHub repo without exposing the details of the connection:

```
Host myhost
  Hostname mydomain.com
  User myuser
  Port 18765
```

With this in place, I could swap the whole _start up Transmit, connect to the server, synchronize the folders, wait 30 seconds, or more, for it to finish_ ceremony with a shockingly-fast `rsync` command:

```bash
rsync --archive --compress --progress --exclude-from=".rsync-exclude" ./ myhost:public_html/path/to/destination
```

A quick breakdown of the various flags:

* `--archive` is a shortcut for a few things: copy all files recursively, and maintain their metadata (permissions, timestamps, etc.). It's "archive" in the sense of "backing up things" rather than "ZIP archive"
* `--compress` compresses files before transferring them
* `--progress` is described in the `rsync` manual as giving _a bored user something to watch_.
* `--exclude-from` specifies a file containing patterns for excluding files from the transfer. You'll probably want to ignore the `.git` folder, `node_modules`, and other things that don't make sense on the server. See a sample file below.
* `./` is the local path. Notice the trailing slash, which instructs `rsync` to copy the _contents_ of the folder, rather than the folder itself.
* `myhost:public_html/path/to/destination` is the remote path. `rsync` knows the `HOST:PATH` pattern refers to SSH, and we've defined `myhost` host in the `~/.ssh/config` file.

And here's the (abridged) `.rsync-exclude` file:

```
/node_modules
/.git
```

You can read more about using `rsync` in these articles:

* [How to Transfer Files with Rsync over SSH](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-transfer-files-with-rsync-over-ssh/)
* [How to Exclude Files and Directories with Rsync](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-exclude-files-and-directories-with-rsync/)

The `man rsync` page is also quite informative.

So long, FTP! (For now, at least)
